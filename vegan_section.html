      <p> Sweet-tasting veggies are not something typically ordered in Italy, but this extravagant Sicilian concoction will win anyone over. <p>
        It’s a sweet and sour mix of different vegetables dressed in a sauce of tomato extract, onions, celery, capers and olives.
        There are many Caponata variations but most use small potatoes, eggplant and bell peppers cooked with almonds, pine nuts, raisins, sugar, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.

        <p>Maultaschen from Swabia are a lot like ravioli but bigger. They are typically palm-sized, square pockets of dough with fillings that run the gamut from savory to sweet and meaty to vegetarian.
            A traditional combination is minced meat, bread crumbs, onions and spinach – all seasoned with salt, pepper and parsley. They’re often simmered and served with broth instead of sauce for a tender, creamier treat, but are sometimes pan-fried and buttered for extra richness.</p>

        <p>Pierogi is undoubtedly Poland’s most famous and simple comfort food.
            But after tasting one of these delicious filled dumplings, you’re likely to find yourself craving more.
            Perogis can be cooked or fried; stuffed with meat, vegetables, cheese, fruit, chocolate; accompanied by a sour cream topping or just butter.</p>
